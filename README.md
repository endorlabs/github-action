# Endor Labs Repository Scan Action

Endor Labs helps developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe Open Source Software (OSS) adoption. Our Dependency Lifecycle Managementâ„¢ Solution helps organizations maximize software reuse by enabling security and development teams to select, secure, and maintain OSS at scale.

The Endor Labs GitHub action may be used to repeatably integrate Endor Labs scanning jobs into your CI pipelines.

## Required Parameters and Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites are required for the Endor Labs GitHub action to successfully run:

- The GitHub action must be able to authenticate to the Endor Labs API. It may authenticate through either:
  - An Endor Labs API key and secret
  - A GCP service account with workload identity federation enabled associated with the runner
- The Endor Labs namespace to authenticate against
- Access to the Endor Labs API

Here is an example of using Endor Labs as a scan step in a job with these pre-requisites:

```
      - name: Example step to scan with Endor Labs
        uses: endorlabs/github-action@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.ENDOR_API_KEY }}
          api_secret: ${{ secrets.ENDOR_API_SECRET }}
          namespace: "testing-tenant"
```

## High Level Usage Steps

1. Setup authentication to Endor Labs
   1. If you are using an API Key and Secret add these as repository secrets
   2. You may also use a GCP service account setup for [keyless authentication from GitHub actions](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions).
2. Checkout your code
3. Install your build toolchain
4. Build your code
5. Scan with Endor Labs

Below is an example workflow to scan with Endor Labs for a Java application.

```
name: Endor Labs Example
on: push
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'microsoft'
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Compile Package
        run: mvn clean install
      - name: Scan with Endor Labs
        uses: endorlabs/github-action@main
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.ENDOR_API_KEY }}
          api_secret: ${{ secrets.ENDOR_API_SECRET }}
          namespace: "example"
```
## Supported Configuration Parameters

The following input parameters are supported configurations for the Endor Labs GitHub action:
